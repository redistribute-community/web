Some people I know are asking for a tool for us — a tool that enhances the best in us and minimizes the worst. This tool doesn't have to be sophisticated. So, I suggest a tool we can trust, something we all understand, our secret shared openly yet designed to improve us collectively.

Intelligence, verified. Time taken for authentic feedback, exchanged between individuals.

I want to be transparent as I write this love letter to our kind. In love, I aim to be hopeful. That's why I'm reaching out — let's be kind, please.

An idea is to rely on community for sustenance. A plea to invest in me; as I would like to invest in you. Us invested.

I don't know which way to go, but I trust you know.
